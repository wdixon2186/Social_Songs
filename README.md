# Social_Songs

Social Songs is a fully functioning python and django application that allows users to upload information on film directors as well as videos of their choosing. 

## FEATURE LIST
Nav

Provides links to the Directors list and videos list.

On the list pages there is a '+' that takes users to a form if they want to add to the database.

Otherwise if they want more information they can click on a video link, or director link to learn more and edit and delete something they posted. 



## INSTALLATION
Because this app isn't deployed, you will need to clone down this repo. Install 'django' and 'Pillow', then from your virtual enviornment, run the server and go to your localhost:8000


## THOUGHT PROCESS
When building this app I only started with one model, and built that out to make sure it reached full crud capability. I then styled how I wanted my page to look, and began work on a second model. Wanting to see if I could incorporate user uploaded videos, I followed a tutorial and built out another model for videos.
